This project focuses on creating interactive educational content for financial psychology. The HTML components are self-contained with embedded CSS and JavaScript, designed for:
- Mobile-responsive design
- Engaging visual interactions
- Educational exercises that complement book content
- Modern web styling with gradients and smooth animations

## Interactive Component Architecture

Each HTML file follows a consistent pattern:
- Responsive design with mobile-first approach
- Embedded CSS with modern styling (gradients, shadows, animations)
- Vanilla JavaScript for interactivity
- Clean, minimalist UI design
- Focus on user engagement and educational value

This project uses static HTML files with no build system, package manager, or dependencies. All styling and functionality is embedded directly in each HTML file for maximum portability and simplicity.

## Content Focus

The book and interactive components focus on:
- Financial psychology and money mindset
- Wealth acceptance and energy work
- Emotional relationships with money
- Family patterns and financial stories
- Practical exercises for mindset transformation
